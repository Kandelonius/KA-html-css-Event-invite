# KA-html-css-Event-invite
A CSS assignment to write an invitation to some event or something allong those lines
I decided to do it taking inspiration from a Dismemberment Plan song.

Criteria below:

In this project, you'll make an event invite for an event- a party, a workshop, a wedding, 
whatever you want. It should have event title, details, and maybe it'd have a guest list or RSVP button.

Before you start coding, I encourage you to "prototype" it - to plan it out either on paper or with a 
"prototyping" tool. Sketch out the vision you have in your head and go through a few prototypes until you're happy.
