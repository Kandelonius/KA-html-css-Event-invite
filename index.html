        <p>Although this invite has no time or location, 
            No date and no RSVP it is still very useful. Here 
            are just a few things you could do with it:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Take this down to a disco that wouldn't have 
            you in a million years</li>
            <li>Take this to a party all the way across town</li>
            <li>Give this to your crying neighbor</li>
        </ol>
        </div>
        <div id="outcome-backing">
            <p>We suspect that what you'll discover upon 
            using this invite for these purposes is:<br><br>
                1. You'll flash it once and next thing you 
                know is you'll be inside with a drink. While
                it might be satisfying to have made it in, 
                you'll likely not stay too long there as you
                will notice that no one is having much fun.<br>
                2. This party will be thrown by the friend of 
                an ex-thing. We recommend you tell her that 
                you are sorry you came. This will give her 
                the opportunity to assure you that... You 
                are invited, much like it says at the top 
                of this invitation. While that should feel 
                nice you'll probably want to leave the party 
                as well since it won't be all that great.<br>
                3. Upon arriving home you may notice your 
                neighbor crying on his front porch and when 
                you approach him you'll discover (barely) 
                that he failed to attend a party. This 
                invite at that point will have done you 
                little good so you may as well throw it 
                down at his feet and brief him on some of 
                its potential benefits.
